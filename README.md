Simple 3D pickup game used to teach the basics of the Unity Game Engine step-by-step. The goal of the game is to chase and connect with red "pickup" cubes that spawn randomly on the game board.

This is a work in a progress that I am sharing publicly as I add features. This project is shared "as is" for educational purposes only.

* **Unity version: 2019.4.15f1**

## Implementation Notes
* This sample demo app is designed for Standalone PC Desktop only for now. It requires a mouse & keyboard to play.  

## Acknowledgements
* This project uses some art & scripting assets from the [Unity Standard Assets](https://assetstore.unity.com/detail/essentials/asset-packs/standard-assets-for-unity-2017-3-32351), including the FPS controller, some textures and more. The **SimpleActivatorMenu.cs** file had to be edited for compatibility purposes since GUIText is now obsolete.
* This project uses some art assets from the [Unity FPS Microgame](https://learn.unity.com/project/fps-template), including sounds, ambience audio, and skybox texture.
